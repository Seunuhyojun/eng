#### Air-Sea Modeling laboratory [(http://airsea.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://airsea.yonsei.ac.kr)
The interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean is critical to the earth climate. The exchange of momentum, heat and freshwater between the atmosphere and the ocean can shape the circulations in the air and sea, and the exchange of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide impacts the radiation balance of the climate. Our research object is to better understand the air-sea interactions using observations from satellite and manned/unmanned observing platforms as well as using the air-sea coupled model. Our research interests extend to the prediction of the atmosphere and ocean states using the coupled model and data assimilation technique.

#### Atmospheric Predictability and Data Assimilation Laboratory [(apdal.yonsei.ac.kr)](apdal.yonsei.ac.kr)
In APDAL, inherent predictability of weather and climate, model and data assimilation systems, and adaptive observations are studied to improve the quality of numerical weather prediction. In addition, we also study dynamical development of forecast error and high impact weather systems using observations, models, and various theories Including potential vorticity thinking.

#### Atmospheric Radiation Laboratory [(http://atrad.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://atrad.yonsei.ac.kr)
Main focus is on the observation of atmospheric radiative energy and monitoring of ozone layer under the framework of GAW, in this laboratory. Active participation in satellite remote sensing project includes the retrieval of aerosol optical properties from COMS and satellite application projects at Korea Aerospace Research Institute.

#### Atmospheric Remote Sensing Laboratory [(http://arsl.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://arsl.yonsei.ac.kr)
Our research focuses on satellite remote sensing of clouds and precipitation that are key components in the global water and energy cycles. Current research aims to develop precipitation retrieval algorithms for various microwave, visible and infrared sensors. Our research also involves the use of spaceborne- and ground-based observations and cloud-radiative transfer models to understand radiative and physical characteristics of precipitation systems. The other research area includes satellite mission planning and applications of remotely-sensed data to climate study.

####  Biometeorology Laboratory [(http://eapl.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://eapl.yonsei.ac.kr)
The biometeorology laboratory pursues (1) a nationwide sustainable water resource management with "HydroKorea II" project through the synergy of ecohydrological/ biogeochemical measurement, modeling and remote sensing, and (2) carbon cycle monitoring and prediction in Monsoon Asia through CarboEastAsia, a research cluster based on collaborations in carbon flux researches among China, Japan and Korea.

#### Climate Theory Laboratory [(http://climatelab.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://climatelab.yonsei.ac.kr)
We are seeking the principal mechanisms on the past, present, and future climate variability and change. Major research concerns involve understanding of the earth climate changing mechanism from the pale-climate to the future climate, and of the intraseasonal-to-multi-decadal variability.

#### Cloud Physics Laboratory [(http://cloud.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://cloud.yonsei.ac.kr)
In the Cloud Physics Laboratory, we make measurements of physical/chemical properties of atmospheric aerosols, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) distributions, cloud droplet and precipitation drop distributions. Also investigated are the implications of these properties on cloud and precipitation developments and aerosol direct and indirect effects using a convective cloud model, an LES cloud model and a mesoscale model. Main areas of interest include warm rain initiation problem, aerosol direct and indirect effects, CCN-precipitation efficiency relationships, cloud seeding, and fog microphysical processes.

#### Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory [(http://gfdl.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://gfdl.yonsei.ac.kr)
Our research areas are largely divided into LES(Large Eddy Simulation) and OGCM(Ocean General Circulation Model).
We have developed a parallelized LES model for high resolution numerical simulation and have been studying many atmospheric and oceanic turbulence phenomena including cloud microphysics, the atmopheric boundary layer and the oceanic mixed layer. By using OGCM, we also try to have a deeper understanding of the ocean, which plays a crucial role in controlling large scale climate change such as ENSO and global warming.

#### Laboratory for Atmospheric Dynamics [(http://atmosdyn.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://atmosdyn.yonsei.ac.kr)
We have investigated the dynamics of atmospheric gravity waves generated by convective systems and developed their parameterization for the large-scale models. Also we have examined the wave induced severe downslope windstorms and turbulence through observational, theoretical, and numerical modeling approaches.

#### Laboratory for Atmospheric Modeling Research [(http://lamor.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://lamor.yonsei.ac.kr)
We investigate the mechanism of severe weather such as Changma, heavy rainfall, typhoon and heavy snowfall to improve forecasts of these phenomena. Understanding and forecasting of severe weather has become an increasingly important issue as more meteorological disasters have occurred recently. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is essential tool for severe weather research. On-going researches of our group are development of numerical model to improve predictability of severe weather and research on mechanism using numerical modeling and observational data.

#### Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratory [(https://atmchem.yonsei.ac.kr/)](http://atmchem.yonsei.ac.kr/)
Our laboratory basically performs the analyses about the spatiotemporal variation of atmospheric chemicals and their influence on the air quality and atmospheric environment. Present researches focus on the regional distribution and transport pattern of air pollutants in East Asia, the relationship between airborne aerosols and precursors, and characteristics of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone related to the polar environmental change. Eventually, we would better understand the effect of meteorology and climate variability on atmospheric chemistry.

#### Mathematical Atmospheric Physics Laboratory [(https://mapl.yonsei.ac.kr)](https://mapl.yonsei.ac.kr)

We carry out interdisciplinary (atmospheric sciences, mathematics and
physics) theoretical and numerical modeling studies to understand
characteristics of motions and chemical phenomena in the whole
atmosphere including the lower atmosphere (troposphere-stratosphere) and
the upper atmosphere (above 100 km). Focus of our researches includes
understanding of the upper atmosphere environment (near-earth space
environment) and influences of the solar activity and space-borne
energetic particles on the climate variability near the ground.
